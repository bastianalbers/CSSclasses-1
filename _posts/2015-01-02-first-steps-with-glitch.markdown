### How to create a file called index.html
Now it's time for you to create your first website! Open <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/kindhearted-horn?path=index.html:12:4" target="_blank"> this link to glitch</a> editor and click the "Remix" button. Now you have a starting point for your project.

    <p>Click the "Remix" button.</p>

Now in your project, type "Hello World!" or any other sentence you always wanted to read in your favorite browser.

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/hallo-welt.png" alt="Image of the new glitch project with a hello world text">
  <figcaption>
    <p>Now type "Hello World!" or any other sentence.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Now click "Show" with the sunglasses next to it. You can now see the web page. Hooray! You created a web page! Okay, it is still a bit boring, but we will get to that. Glitch automatically updates the page for you any time you change something, so leave it open.
